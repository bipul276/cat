		<h3>Fun Facts</h3>
		<p><b>Whisker Magic:</b> Cats use their whiskers not only for balance but also to determine if they can fit through a tight space. If their whiskers touch the sides, they know they won't fit.</p>
        <p><b>Superior Night Vision:</b> Cats have exceptional night vision, about six times better than that of humans. This ability is thanks to a layer of cells in their eyes called the tapetum lucidum, which reflects light.</p>
